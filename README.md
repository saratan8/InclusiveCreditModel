# Inclusive Credit Model

This project explores inclusive credit scoring using machine learning techniques. The Goal is to include more factors than FICO score does and reach more concrete PD prediction. 

## 📁 Project Structure
- `Calculator_credit.ipynb`: Final scoring model and credit calculator implementation
- `Kaggledata_Project.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis on the credit dataset
- `Scorecard_development_with_OptBinning.ipynb`: Scorecard model training with optimal binning
- `macro_.ipynb`: Macro-economic factor integration
- `scorecard_table_detailed.csv`: Output scorecard mapping table

## 📊 Techniques Used
- Logistic Regression
- XGB, Random Forest
- Macroeconomic variable adjustment

## 🧠 Goal
Build a fair and interpretable credit scoring system that is robust and inclusive, while integrating external macroeconomic features.
